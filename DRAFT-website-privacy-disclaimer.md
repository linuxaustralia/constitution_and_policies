# Linux Australia Website Privacy Policy and Disclaimer 

## What does this Privacy Policy and Disclaimer apply to? 

This Policy applies to the Linux Australia, Inc. website 

_FOR DISCUSSION: Should this policy also apply to linux.conf.au? What about other conference websites? Do they have their own privacy policies? Should this be generic enough to be able to be used by other conferences / events? It might be a useful "value add" that we can provide. That begs the additional question of whether there should be a requirement on conferences and events to have a Privacy Policy, just like we require a link on their website back to the Linux Australia website?_
