##How to create invoice
Invoices are commercial documents issued by a seller to a buyer. For your event most invoices are supplied to your sponsors or any buyers of tickets who don't want to go via ticketing system (eg bulk ticket sales).

Things to remember:

* Donâ€™t create new accounts, if a new account is required, please, contact Linux Australia.
* If a sponsor has an Australian office, it's a local sponsorship and Australian taxes apply, otherwise it's international sponsorship and international taxes apply.
* In case of an error, you can edit invoices before end of quarter, but after Business Activity Statement (BAS) is generated there's a special process, please, contact Linux Australia.

##How to reconcile transactions
After payment on invoice is received, Xero's account displays a number of transactions required to be reconciled.
If there's only one transactions per invoice and values match - it's pretty easy, Xero matches transaction and invoice, and just click OK.

Some complications: 

- [Reconcile multiple transactions into one invoice](http://www.easyonlinebookkeeping.com.au/xero-basics/multiple-payments/).
- TODO: International transactions
