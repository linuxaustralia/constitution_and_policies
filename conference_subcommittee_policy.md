# LA Conference Subcommittee Policy

## Rationale

One of Linux Australia’s goals is to provide members of our community with forums for discussion of Free and Open Source technologies. To facilitate these events, Linux Australia provides a legal structure, and administrative services on behalf of our community.

Linux Australia forms conference and event subcommittees in order to delegate responsibility for the organisation of individual conferences to enthusiastic members of our community. This includes delegating access to funds and bank accounts, and delegating authority to contract venues and suppliers for events.

This subcommittee policy exists to ensure that conferences are run effectively, and to minimise financial risk and liabilities to the greater organisation. It ensures that our community has oversight of our events, and ensures that our events are run to a high standard.

This policy replaces Linux Australia’s former subcommittee policy, which involved appointing a subcommittee for each instance of each conference. This previously left open the question of conference selection and succession of conference teams.

Linux Australia also has the following requirements for conference subcommittees that need to be addressed:
* More frequent reporting of conference activities
* Greater oversight of budgeting and expenditure of conference funds
* More frequent reporting of the financial state of the conference to council
* Increasing due diligence for conference selection

The intention of this policy is to ensure that reporting is not arduous, but substantially increases Council’s awareness of how a conference is performing. It also nominates specific avenues for conference organisers to seek advice.

This document draws on current PyCon Australia practice, and adopts some ideas from how the Python Software Foundation governs the PyCon (US) conference.


## Structure

Each conference will have a single, long-standing subcommittee, which we’ll call a Steering Committee. In future, Steering Committees will be formed instead of the short-standing subcommittees for each instance of the conference.

Subcommittees are created by the Linux Australia Council, and each subcommittee will continue to exist at the discretion of the Council. Subcommittee members serve at the discretion of the council.

A steering subcommittee consists of representatives of the team hosting the current rotation of the conference (the “site team”), and trusted representatives of the community.

The subcommittee consists of two site team representatives and three community representatives. This is to ensure that community members with the long-term interest of the conference in mind have greater say than those who are more interested in the success of the current instance of the conference. All subcommittee members must be members of Linux Australia.

If fewer than three community representatives can be appointed, council shall act as the remaining community representatives for the purposes of voting and quorum.

At least the following roles should be in place:

### Site Chair (Conference Director; President of the Steering Committee)

The lead organiser of the conference, and presides over any meeting of the subcommittee. Is directly responsible for the forthcoming instance of the conference.

### Treasurer

A member of the site team. Is responsible for preparing conference budgets for consideration by the subcommittee. Prepares invoices for debtors. Prepares payments from the conference bank account for approval, and is responsible for ensuring conference debts are paid on time.

### Community Representatives

Advises the subcommittee on decisions, and acts as a guiding influence to the remainder of the subcommittee. Ensures that financial decisions made by the site team have the long-term interest of the conference and LA in mind. Should be appointed from past organisers of the conference, or from trusted members of the community.

The subcommittee should appoint at least two members with the ability to sign payments to the conference bank account: one must be the subcommittee treasurer.

### Other Roles

Steering committees may at their discretion define other formal roles, but if they are filled by people other than the two site team representatives and three community representatives, these people shall only be recognised as observers of subcommittee meetings.


## Role of the Subcommittee

Subcommittees will perform at least the following tasks, to ensure that their conference runs successfully, is handed over, and reports their financial situation to the council.

### Nomination of Community Representatives

* Community representatives shall be nominated by the membership, or by the Linux Australia council.
* Community representatives shall be appointed by council from nominees.
* Community representatives shall serve for terms of one year, commencing from the conclusion of one conference, to the beginning of the following year’s conference.
* Community representatives may be appointed for further terms as council sees fit.

### Conference Bids and Selection (Appointment of New Site Team Representatives)

* The subcommittee will design a bid process and receive bids for hosting a rotation of the conference. Bid processes must be approved by the LA Council before announcement.
* A successful bid results in the subcommittee nominating two site team representatives, and designating the length of their terms. Bids shall be put to council for final approval.
* For new or lapsed conferences, the site representatives shall be appointed upon request to the council.
* For recurring conferences, the subcommittee should aim to advertise a bid process and accept a bid at least one year in advance of the conference instance being bid upon.
* The site team representatives-elect become observers of the subcommittee upon their bids being accepted, until the conference immediately preceding their rotation concludes.
* The outgoing site representatives shall remain as observers until council has deemed that the business of their rotation of the conference has concluded.

### Handover and Delegation of Authority

* Observers to the subcommittee are either appointed automatically through processes in this policy, or by the voting members of the subcommittee.
* The subcommittee may appoint observers to the subcommittee by majority vote.
* The council can delegate authority to execute specific business of the subcommittee to any observer recognised by the subcommittee by majority vote.

### Budgeting

* The subcommittee will meet regularly to approve budgets proposed by the treasurer.
* For new conferences, budget models should demonstrate viability based on a minimum number of delegates, by negotiation with council, as well as attracting no sponsorship.
* For recurring conferences, initial budget models should demonstrate viability based on at least a 15% reduction in attendance over the previous year, and no initial sponsorship.
* Subsequent tracking budgets will also take into account actual collected sponsorship and registration funds, as well as expenses committed at the time of budgeting.
* Budgets should consider both direct concerns of the conference, and long-term investments in the community
Direct concerns including the direct operation of the conference, including venues and catering, funding speakers’ attendance, etc; operating contingencies should also be budgeted for.
* Where contingencies are spent, future budgets should have contingencies allocated to budget line items.
Long-term concerns include funding outreach programmes, and returning a profit to Linux Australia
* Budget decisions must be submitted to the Linux Australia Council for final approval, accompanied by a report.
* Subcommittees must act within the constraints of the budget most recently approved by Council.
* The accuracy of budgets should be evidenced by written quotations and contracts where such documentation exists.
* Documentation of costs and liabilities must be required for items representing more than 3% of the total expenses of the conference, or $5000, whichever is lower.

### Profits

* Subcommittees must budget with the intention of returning a surplus of funds to Linux Australia. The proceeds of a conference contribute to the ongoing financial stability of Linux Australia and its ability to facilitate and support open technology communities.
* Profits also go towards covering costs incurred by Linux Australia in administrative overheads including insurance, auditing, grant funding and the risk of loss: such costs would be otherwise incurred by a conference not run under the auspices of Linux Australia.
* Conferences must nominate a profit of at least 10% of gross revenue based on their model budget. Where conferences exceed their modelled revenue, the expected return of the conference shall be subject to negotiation with council.

### Meeting and Voting

* The subcommittee shall meet as often as is appropriate to amend their budgets and request to have funds made available.
* The quorum for meetings shall be three subcommittee members.
* If the Site Chair is not present at a meeting, the site chair shall nominate the role of presiding officer to another subcommittee member in advance of the meeting.
* Motions may only be passed by majority of all subcommittee members
* In the case of absence from a meeting, a subcommittee member may register their vote with the presiding officer in advance of the meeting.
* If a subcommittee member fails to vote at three consecutive meetings, the subcommittee may move a motion requesting the expulsion of that subcommittee member.

### Reporting

* The subcommittee must report to the Linux Australia council regularly, in the form of minuted decisions and reports made by the subcommittee, including any budget updates.
* Minutes shall be made available to the membership; items may be denoted in camera for items that need to be kept private from the membership.
* Financial obligations (including payment amounts and deadlines) must be reported, so the Council treasurer can make funds available to the subcommittee at appropriate times.
* New financial obligations must be reported alongside an updated budget which takes into account the current financial situation of the conference.
* Council may, from time to time, request to meet with subcommittee members to discuss the state of the conference.


## Responsibilities of Linux Australia

Linux Australia and the council will ensure that the following tasks are completed, to allow the subcommittee to successfully run the conference.

### Budgeting and Conference Finance

* The Council shall vote to approve budgets submitted by the subcommittee at the first available opportunity.
* The Council shall hold the conference’s funds until such time as the Council believes these are required by the subcommittee.
* The Council will release funds to the Site Chair and Treasurer to execute; the amount of funds made available should take into account contracted payment deadlines, per the reports made by the subcommittee.

### Appointment of Subcommittee Members

* Council shall appoint subcommittee members from eligible nominations in a time frame that will not impact the operation of the conference.
* Where a council appoints new members to the subcommittee, the council will update the subcommittee register appropriately.
* The council will not appoint subcommittee members without a minuted nomination from the membership, except:
* When the community fails to nominate members after members’ designated terms expire
* When it is of the opinion of the council that the subcommittee is acting against the financial interests of Linux Australia

### Expulsion of Subcommittee Members

* Where the subcommittee passes an expulsion motion, the Council will, at the first available opportunity, ensure that the subcommittee register is updated, and that a replacement is appointed in line with the policy.

### Dispute Resolution

* Any member of the association may appeal to the Linux Australia council regarding a minuted decision of the subcommittee to request arbitration. In this case, arbitration may be performed at the discretion of council.
* If two committee members appeal to the Linux Australia council regarding a minuted decision of the subcommittee, the Linux Australia council MUST engage in arbitration.
