# Linux Australia Grants

## Guidelines for Submissions

Linux Australia grants are available to projects which benefit the Open Source community, particularly in Australia and New Zealand. While each grant is evaluated by the Linux Australia Council on its own merits, the relevance and applicability to the wider community is a significant consideration when determining the outcome of a grant proposal.

Within the total funding pool available during the grants program, there are no specific limits on the value of the grants. However, grants which request larger sums of money should include more detail and can expect to attract greater scrutiny.

The following points may guide members while preparing grant applications.

* Background information about the group or individual behind the grant application is useful, particularly if it is not being done by a well-established Open Source project or group. This makes it easier for the Linux Australia Council to determine how the project fits into the broader community.
* A Linux Australia grant should target a specific activity or event. While applications for general support will be considered, such a proposal would need to include a detailed explanation of how the funds would ultimately benefit the broader Open Source community (rather than a select few associated with the grant).
* A grant application should include an explanation as to how the requested amount was determined. While formal quotations are not generally required, realistic estimates should be used wherever possible.
* Historically, most successful Linux Australia grants have been for amounts of less than AUDÂ 5,000. Applications for amounts close to this value (or higher) are expected to include a more rigorous justification for the amount requested.

The range of projects which could be funded by Linux Australia grants is as varied as the imagination of our members. The following non-exhaustive list gives examples of activities which could form the basis of a successful application.

* Sponsorship of an event (such as a user group event, conference, hackfest or meetup)
* Implementation of specific features in Open Source Software
* Development of an Open Hardware project
* Provision of specific infrastructure which benefits an Open Source organisation
* Subsidising attendance at an Open Source event for community members from diverse backgrounds
* Assisting a community member to attend an overseas Open Source event to represent the Open Source community of Australia and New Zealand
* Funding a speaker to travel to an event within Australia or New Zealand

In contrast, proposals which are unlikely to be accepted include:

* Contributions to the general revenue stream of an organisation or company
* Coverage of expenses associated with the operational overheads of a company
* Funding of activities which provide no obvious benefits to the broader Open Source community
* Development of hardware or software which will not be released under an open licence
* Applications which lack justification and explanation of the amount requested

The Linux Australia Council welcomes the opportunity to work with the authors of grant applications if assistance is needed to transform ideas into a viable proposal.
