#﻿Mailing list policy
##Definitions
###Council
The member-elected governing body of Linux Australia. Council has the authority to create, moderate and delete lists and list postings for all mailing lists it hosts, and the authority to delegate these actions to Moderators. Council is responsible for the creation, promulgation and enforcement of this policy.

###Moderator
A natural person with delegated authority to create, moderate, and delete lists and list postings in line with this policy. A moderator is appointed at the pleasure of Council and may be changed at Council's discretion. Council authorises Moderators to act without seeking prior approval from Council and trusts them to exercise their duties in a responsible and professional manner.


###List member
A natural person, who may or may not be a member of Linux Australia, who has voluntarily or as part of their membership of Linux Australia, been subscribed to one or more mailing lists hosted by Linux Australia. To continue being a list member, the list member accepts to be bound by this policy.
##Introduction and rationale
This document outlines policy in relation to acceptable use of mailing lists hosted by Linux Australia. This policy exists so that;

* List participants have a clear understanding of what is acceptable
* Moderators of the list alike have a clear understanding of what is acceptable and a basis to take corrective action if required
* and so that mailing lists are a better instrument for furthering the values of Linux Australia - open technology, community, freedom, respect and diversity.


This policy therefore articulates boundaries around acceptable use of mailing lists hosted by Linux Australia, and defines appropriate actions and recourse where those boundaries are transgressed.

##Policy

1. Creation of lists

  a. Any Member of Linux Australia may request in writing to Council that a mailing list (‘list’) be created. The request will contain the purpose of the list and the names of 2 (two) proposed Moderators, who will be Members of Linux Australia. Council will consider the creation request, and if approved ensure the list is created with the nominated Moderators ascribed appropriate privileges in line with this policy.

  b. The decision to reject a list creation request is final and cannot be appealed, although the Council must provide a justification for rejection in writing to the requestor.

  c. By default lists will be created such that;
    1. They are publicly viewable and archived
    2. They are not in moderation by default
    3. That subscription requests must be confirmed
    4. That only list participants may post to the list

    List moderators will be able to deviate from these defaults at their discretion to best serve the needs of List Members.

2. Appointment of Moderators

  a. At creation, each list will have two Moderators appointed. Moderators will ensure that there are 2 (two) Moderators active for each list at all times, and will inform Council in writing if new Moderators should be appointed for a list.

  b. Council will consider such a request and act to ensure ongoing moderation for a list, or alternatively determine that the list should be decommissioned.

3. Acceptable use of list

  a. A Linux Australia list may be created to support discussion, free and open exchange of ideas and to build social and intellectual capital amongst list participants in the fields of open technology, culture, hardware and software.

  b. List participants may subscribe voluntarily or be subscribed as part of their membership of Linux Australia, if they are a member.

  c. List participants shall be able to unsubscribe at any time.

  d. List participants shall ensure that postings they make to a list will not contain;

    1. offensive verbal or written remarks related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race or religion;

    2. sexual or violent imagery or written depictions thereof;

    3. sexist, racist, or other exclusionary jokes;

    4. deliberately inflammatory remarks intended to divide, damage or provoke ill will within the community - commonly referred to as ‘troll bait’.

4. Moderation of acceptable use of list

  a. Should a violation of clause 3(d) occur, the Moderators of a list should confer and reach consensus that a violation has occurred and that response action is warranted.

  b. The moderators may choose from an escalating list of response actions to ensure appropriate use of the list, including;

    1. Private email to the transgressor outlining how they have transgressed the policy and requesting them to refrain

    2. Temporarily banning the transgressor from the list for a period not exceeding thirty (30) days

    3. Placing the list into emergency moderation or 'slowdown' mode

    4. Permanently banning the transgressor from the list

    5. Recommending to Linux Australia Council that the transgressor’s membership of Linux Australia (if a member) be revoked in line with the Constitution

    6. Other actions as deemed appropriate to the context and circumstance, and agreed to by Moderators and the Linux Australia Council

5. Right to appeal

  a. A transgressor who is the target of a response action from a moderator under 4(b) may appeal to Council.

  b. Council will deliberate and provide a ruling within 14 (fourteen) days of receiving an appeal.

  c. Council may choose from the following outcomes;

    1. Council may uphold the actions of the Moderators

    2. Council may find that the actions of the Moderators were not in line with this policy and choose to counsel the Moderators or revoke their Moderation privileges and reinstate any privileges of the list member

    3. Council may find that the actions of the Moderators were lenient and apply harsher actions to the transgressor
