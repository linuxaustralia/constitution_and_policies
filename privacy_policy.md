Linux Australia Privacy Policy
==============================

# About this policy

Linux Australia, Inc.  (“Linux Australia”) operates under the Australian
Privacy Principles as defined in the *Australian Privacy Act 1988*.  While
Linux Australia is not required to be bound by the Privacy Act, Linux
Australia has chosen to follow the Australian Privacy Principles in the
interests of openness and transparency.  To this end, this Privacy Policy
outlines the personal information handling practices employed by Linux
Australia.

This policy is written in simple language.  The specific obligations of
Linux Australia when collecting and handling your personal information are
outlined in the *Privacy Act 1988* with particular reference to the
Australian Privacy Principles found in that Act.  Linux Australia will
update this privacy policy when our information handling practices change. 
Updates will be provided on our website.

This policy was last updated on 8 December 2021.

# Overview

Linux Australia represents users of Open Source and Open Technology in
Australia and New Zealand.  Linux Australia is not active outside this
geographic area.

We collect, hold, use and disclose personal information in order to carry
out activities as permitted under the *Privacy Act 1988* (Privacy Act).

These functions and activities include:
* Coordinating the organisation’s activities
* Managing events
* Accepting payment for products and services
* Delivering items
* Providing support to members as deemed appropriate

# Collection of your personal information

Linux Australia only collects the minimum amount of information required to
carry out its activities and functions.

Personal information is primarily collected when supplied to us in the
course of our interaction with you.  For example, when you send an email
with an enquiry we will store your email address to allow us to send a
reply.

To facilitate communication with you, Linux Australia may collect and store
your name, the company you work for, your email address, fax number and
phone numbers.

Linux Australia will collect and store your address when you apply to become
a member.  This is required by law under the Associations Incorporation Act
2009 in New South Wales, Australia, where Linux Australia is incorporated. 
Linux Australia may also collect and store your address if needed to arrange
billing or product delivery.

Linux Australia does not collect or store any other information about you
for the purposes of running Linux Australia because the organisation does
not need it.  However, events facilitated by Linux Australia may collect
additional personal information in order to run the event or to help plan
future events.  Unless overridden by an event-specific privacy policy, the
collection and management of the additional information will be governed by
this privacy policy.

Some jurisdictions restrict the collection of personal information from
people under certain ages.  Since Linux Australia does not collect or store
birth dates we are unable to actively police this.  By providing personal
information to Linux Australia you are warranting that your information can
be collected and stored by Linux Australia.

Your personal information is only collected when supplied by you.  Linux
Australia does not collect personal information through any other means.

# Additional information collected

When you interact with us electronically there are a number of other ways in
which information about you may be collected.

## Analytics

Linux Australia may employ third party analytics companies to provide data
about how you interact with our website.  Presently this service is provided
by Google Analytics.  Information which may be collected when browsing our
website include but is not limited to:
* Your device's IP address
* Device screen size 
* Device type, operating system and browser information 
* Geographic location
* Referring domain and out link if applicable 
* Pages visited 
* Date and time when website pages were accessed 

This information is not linked to you personally and cannot be traced to an
individual.  Linux Australia does not disclose this information to any third
parties.

## Cookies

Cookies are small data files transferred onto computers or devices by
websites for record-keeping purposes and to enhance functionality on the
website.  The Linux Australia website creates and uses cookies solely to
manage your interaction with the website (your login status for example).

Browsing the Linux Australia website will typically cause a Google Analytics
cookie to be set due to the use of the third party Google Analytics service. 
The handling of Google Analytics cookies by Google is governed by [Google's
Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) and 
[Google’s Cookies Policy](https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies?hl=en).

Most browsers allow you to choose whether to accept cookies or not.  If you
do not wish to have cookies placed on your computer, please set your browser
preferences to reject all cookies before accessing our website.  You may
also wish to clear any associated cookies which were stored before making
this change.  Some functionality of our website (such as member login) will
not be available or work correctly if cookies are disabled.

## Website enquiry form

If you use the enquiry form offered on our website, your name and your
contact email address provided by you on the form will be stored to allow us
to respond to your enquiry.

## Social networking services

We use social networking services such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and
YouTube to communicate with the public about our business.  When you
communicate with us using these services we may collect your personal
information as supplied by you through these platforms, but we only use it
to help us to communicate with you and the public.  Your use of social
networking services for any purpose (including but not limited to
communication with Linux Australia) gives the social media providers access
to your personal information.  These services have their own privacy
policies and Linux Australia has no control over how these services operate. 
You can access the privacy policies for 
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/privacy?lang=en), 
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy), 
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/legal/FB_Work_Privacy) and
[YouTube](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) (a part of 
Google) on their websites.

## Mailing lists

Linux Australia runs a number of opt-in mailing lists for the benefit of
members and the community.  These mailing lists are publicly accessible and
are archived for future reference.  Subscribers to these mailing lists are
responsible for all material they choose to post.

## Credit card information

Linux Australia accepts credit card payments for certain products and
services (mostly conference registration fees).  These payments are handled
entirely by our third party payment gateway.  Credit card details provided
in connection with such payments are never seen by Linux Australia.  The
provision of information to the credit card payment gateway will be subject
to the terms and conditions of that gateway.

## Linux Australia events

Events associated with Linux Australia use their own systems to manage the
event.  This may include a website, and services like Google Drive for
administration.  These services are managed by the conference organising
teams and as such may make use of third party services beyond those outlined
in this Privacy Policy.  The provision of personal information to these
systems is controlled by the Privacy Policy of the event (if different from
this policy) and the terms and conditions of the respective online services.

# Disclosure

Regardless of how the information was collected, Linux Australia does not
disclose your personal information to any third parties unless this is
required to carry out normal activities or we are compelled to by law, law
enforcement or the Linux Australia Constitution.

When shipping products you have purchased or sending items to you,
Linux Australia will disclose your delivery address to the postal service or
freight agents used to deliver your goods or items.

Linux Australia will never sell the personal information it collects.

Information collected by analytics companies and social media platforms is
subject to the retention and disclosure policies of the respective
companies.  Linux Australia has no control over these processes.  This
information may be held outside of Australia.

# Storage and security of personal information

Linux Australia considers it a privilege to be entrusted with information
about you and secures this information accordingly against unauthorised
access.  All personal information is primarily stored in Australia, and we
ensure that only people who require your information have access to it.

Linux Australia makes use of “Google Drive” to store some correspondence and
other documentation related to the administration of the organisation. 
Examples include formal written letters and extracts from electronic
communication which are the subject of discussion by the Linux Australia
Council.  Personal information contained in such documents may therefore be
incidentally stored on Google servers.  When stored on Google Drive, such
information is subject to the 
[Google terms and conditions](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/).
If communication with Linux Australia includes a clear statement requesting
that personal information not be stored on Google Drive, Linux Australia
will honour that request.

Upon discovery of a data breach, Linux Australia will:
* Initiate immediate action to secure the affected systems and the
  information held on them.
* Make every effort to inform victims of the breach and its nature.
* Alert relevant authorities as required under the Australian *Privacy Act*.
* Comply with all requests by law enforcement authorities.

# Accessing and correcting personal information

Under the *Privacy Act* (Australian Privacy Principles 12 and 13) you have the
right to ask for access to personal information that we hold about you, and
ask that we correct that personal information.  You can ask for access or
correction by contacting us and we must respond within 30 days.  If you ask,
we must give you access to your personal information, and take reasonable
steps to correct it if we consider it is incorrect, unless there is a law
that allows or requires us not to.

We will ask you to verify your identity before we give you access to your
information or correct it, and we will try to make the process as simple as
possible.  If we refuse to give you access to, or correct, your personal
information, we must notify you in writing setting out the reasons.

If we make a correction and we have disclosed the incorrect information to
others, you can ask us to tell them about the correction.  We must do so
unless there is a valid reason not to.

You may request that we delete any personal information we have stored about
you.  Such a request must be in writing.  If we receive such a request and
after verifying your identity we will take all reasonable steps to remove
your information from all of our systems.

# How to make a complaint

If you wish to complain to us about how we have handled your personal
information you should complain in writing.  Please contact us if you need
help with this process.

If we receive a complaint from you about how we have handled your personal
information we will determine what action we could and should take to
resolve the complaint.
